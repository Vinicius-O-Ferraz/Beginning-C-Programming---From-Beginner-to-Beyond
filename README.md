This Course is based on the Beginning-C-Programming---From-Beginner-to-Beyond. You can check this course at this link:

Here I will register my studies and all the code produced in this process.

## Why you should learn C++

Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years. 

Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.

There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!

Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.

Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.

## What will I learn in this course?

The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.

Key topics covered include.

* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion
* Performing calculations and displaying results
* Functions
* Pointers
* Using existing classes and creating objects
* Creating your own classes
* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector
* Constructors and Destructors
* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment 
* How to overload operators
* Using inheritance and class hierarchies
* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding 
* Using smart pointers
* Using stream I/O
* An introduction to the C++ STL
* An introduction to Exception Handling
* And much more.
